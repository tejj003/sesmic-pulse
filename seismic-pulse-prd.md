# Seismic Pulse - Product Requirements Document

## Product Overview

**Seismic Pulse** is an interactive web-based visualization tool that displays real-time earthquake data from around the world in an engaging, artistic format. The application provides users with a visually compelling way to explore global seismic activity, combining data art with informative elements to create an educational and aesthetically pleasing experience.

## Target Audience

- Educators and students in earth science and geography
- Data visualization enthusiasts
- General public interested in earthquake activity
- Science museums and educational institutions
- Emergency management professionals

## Core Features

### 1. Real-time Data Visualization

- **Data Source**: Integration with USGS Earthquake API for near real-time earthquake data
- **Auto-refresh**: Automatic data updates every 3 minutes to ensure current information
- **Fallback Mechanism**: Alternative API endpoint and demo data generation if primary source fails

### 2. Visualization Modes

- **Artistic Mode**: 
  - Displays earthquakes in an orbital pattern around a central point
  - Magnitude represented by size, color, and orbital distance
  - Interactive particle effects and connecting lines for visual appeal
  - Central glow and grid background for depth perception

- **Geographic Mode**:
  - World map representation with proper longitude and latitude
  - Grid lines and labels for geographic context
  - Earthquake locations mapped to their actual coordinates
  - Visual indicators for equator and prime meridian

### 3. Interactive Elements

- **Tooltips**: Hover over earthquake points to display detailed information
  - Magnitude with color coding
  - Location with truncation for long names
  - Depth in kilometers
  - Date of occurrence

- **Cursor Feedback**: Change of cursor when hovering over interactive elements

### 4. Information Display

- **Statistics Panel**:
  - Total number of earthquakes
  - Strongest earthquake magnitude
  - Latest earthquake location
  - Last data update timestamp

- **Magnitude Legend**:
  - Color-coded scale explaining earthquake magnitudes
  - Categories: Minor (0.0-2.5), Light (2.5-4.5), Moderate (4.5-6.0), Strong (6.0-7.0), Major (7.0+)

## Technical Requirements

### 1. Performance

- **Rendering Optimization**: Support for high-DPI/Retina displays
- **Particle System Management**: Limit maximum particles to prevent performance issues
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of animation frames when switching modes

### 2. Compatibility

- **Browser Support**: Modern browsers with HTML5 Canvas support
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes and resolutions
- **Touch Support**: Considerations for touch interaction on mobile and tablet devices

### 3. Data Handling

- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when API connections fail
- **Timeout Handling**: 10-second timeout for API requests to prevent hanging
- **Data Processing**: Efficient sorting and filtering of earthquake data

## User Experience

### 1. Visual Design

- **Color Scheme**: Dark background with bright, contrasting colors for data points
- **Typography**: Clean, legible sans-serif fonts
- **Animation**: Smooth transitions and subtle animations for engaging experience
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Clear distinction between different UI components

### 2. Interaction Design

- **Mode Switching**: Easy toggle between visualization modes
- **Information Access**: Intuitive hover interactions for detailed information
- **Loading States**: Clear indication when data is being fetched

## Future Enhancements (Roadmap)

1. **Time Range Selection**: Allow users to select different time periods (past week, month, year)
2. **Filtering**: Enable filtering by magnitude, region, or depth
3. **Animation Timeline**: Playback controls to animate earthquake occurrences over time
4. **Social Sharing**: Ability to share screenshots or links to current view
5. **Notifications**: Optional alerts for significant seismic events
6. **Historical Data**: Access to and visualization of historical earthquake patterns
7. **3D Visualization**: Earth globe representation with depth visualization
8. **Offline Support**: Progressive Web App features for offline functionality

## Technical Implementation Notes

- Built using vanilla JavaScript, HTML5 Canvas for rendering
- Responsive design with device pixel ratio awareness
- Custom particle system for visual effects
- Data fetched from USGS Earthquake API with fallback options
- No external dependencies required for core functionality

## Success Metrics

- User engagement time on visualization
- Number of mode switches per session
- API reliability and fallback activation rate
- Browser compatibility coverage
- Performance metrics on various devices
